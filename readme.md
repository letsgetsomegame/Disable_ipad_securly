How to disable securly, goguardian, and more on an ipad!!!!!


step one: open settings, and got to wifi, and click on the i with a circle, for whatever wifi you are on.   (This exploit has to be done manully on every network)


Go to configure dns, click on manual, delete all of the ip adreseses there, and then add 167.86.91.171 !!! securly is now disabled on that wifi network.
